using this file to explain some json files.

The en_us.json file is meant to translate your mod variable names in intelliJ, into the displayed mod names in game.
Using the example of Opaque Ingot:
"item.monophobia.opaque_ingot": "Opaque Ingot"
the item.monophobia is using the modname to clarify where the item is coming from
the opaque_ingot is the name of the item
the "Opaque Ingot" is the in game display name of the item

The format of item json files in the item directory under models consists of the following:
  "parent":"minecraft:item/generated",
  "textures": {
    "layer0": "monophobia:item/opaque_ingot"
the "parent" is to describe how the model will be displayed with "minecraft:item/generated"
indicating that its going to be displayed like a normal minecraft item while held in your hand (that sort of 2d/3d mix)
the "textures": { defines the texture for the item
and the "layer0": "monophobia:item/opaque_ingot" is the actual texture that is going to be defined, the png found in
the textures directory, in this case under items.
